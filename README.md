# FlaskAPI

This repo holds my basic studies of Flask, by implementing an example system that is responsible to store and compute data about Hotels and the Websites that they are listed on, similarly to Trivago, and also Users data with JWT authentication to send HTTP requests to the application. This is a really simple project and the purpose of this application was to apply part of my back-end knowledge from other stacks to a new Framework, to learn how powerful a high-level language can be, and most importantly, to never stop learning.

To reach this, I followed this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-apis-com-python-e-flask/
